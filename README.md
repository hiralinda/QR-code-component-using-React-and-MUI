## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) - React UI library

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:
- Creating responsive layouts using Material-UI's `Stack` component
- Implementing custom styles within the Material-UI framework
- Handling different screen sizes with responsive design techniques

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to focus on:
- Developing with less need of tutorial videos
- Improving accessibility features
- Exploring more advanced Material-UI components

### Useful resources

- [React Learner YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ReactLearnerWeb): This channel provided excellent tutorials on React and Material-UI implementation. Their step-by-step explanations were particularly helpful in understanding how to structure components and apply responsive designs.

- [Material-UI Documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/): The official Material-UI documentation was invaluable for understanding the proper usage of components like Stack and Typography, as well as how to customize them to fit the design requirements.
